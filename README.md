Hello, welcome to the work on the Hungry Void mod. 
This is a modification and update upon Apex Xenos worked on by InternIsla

The aim of this is to both re-implement lost features from older versions into a more modern version of Stellaris. 
Along with adding new content, events, traits, buildings, and so on.

Though while I make the code and implement things, I am not a great artist or writer. As such if anyone wishes to add text ideas or icons/art to the mod it would be greatly appreatiated.
